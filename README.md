## üíª API Endpoints (Postman Collection)

To easily test all the backend functionalities, you can import the provided Postman Collection.

### üì• Import Steps

1.  **Download Postman** if you don't have it installed.
2.  **Download the Collection File** from the root of this repository:
    * `Automate.postman_collection.json`
3.  **Import the Collection:**
    * In Postman, click **File -> Import** and select the downloaded `Automate.postman_collection.json` file.
4.  **Set the Base URL:**
    * The collection is configured to use an environment variable called `{{url}}`. Ensure your Postman environment's `url` variable is set to your local server address: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`

### üîë Authentication Flow

All authenticated endpoints require an **Authorization Header** with a **Bearer Token**.

1.  Run the **`POST /login`** request.
2.  The response token is automatically saved to the Postman environment variable `{{token}}`.
3.  All subsequent requests will use `Bearer {{token}}` for authorization.
